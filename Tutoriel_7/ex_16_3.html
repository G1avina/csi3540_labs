<p>
    In traditional web applications, client-server interactions typically involve the client (web browser) 
    sending requests to the server to fetch entire web pages. Each time a user interacts with the application, 
    such as clicking a link or submitting a form, the entire page is refreshed, and a new request is sent to the server. 
    The server processes the request, generates a new HTML page, and sends it back to the client.

With Ajax
<p>
    In AJAX web applications, client-server interactions are more dynamic and asynchronous. 
    AJAX allows for partial updates of web pages without requiring a full page reload. Instead of fetching entire HTML pages, 
    the client can send asynchronous requests to the server in the background using JavaScript. These requests typically retrieve 
    data from the server in formats like JSON or XML. After receiving the data, the client-side JavaScript 
    can manipulate the DOM to update specific parts of the page dynamically, without reloading the entire page.
