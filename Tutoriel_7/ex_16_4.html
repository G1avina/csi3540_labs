Q 16.4:
<p>
You could hold data localy using Javascript. The app could send 1 xmlhttp request to the server on start up
to collect all data that you would hold localy. Then when you add data you can add it localy and when performing searches you dont need 
to do a request to the server. All data added can be sent to the server with 1 request at a later point.
